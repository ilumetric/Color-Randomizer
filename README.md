# Color Randomizer

This Blender addon simplifies the process of randomizing object colors.

## Description

The Color Randomizer addon addresses the common issue of adjacent objects having the same or very similar colors, ensuring a vibrant variety. With a single button press, it randomizes the color of an object. You can manually refine the result by repeatedly pressing the button until you find the perfect color. Additionally, the addon:

- Adds a prefix to object names to ensure each color is unique.
- Provides an option to easily remove this prefix when your work is complete.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ilumetric/color-randomizer) page.
2. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
3. Click `Install`, select the downloaded `.zip` file, and activate the addon.

## Usage

1. Select one or more objects in your scene.
2. Use the buttons in the top toolbar of the 3D Viewport.
3. Click the "Randomize Color" button to assign random colors.
4. (Optional) Use the "Remove Prefix" button to clean up object names after randomization.
